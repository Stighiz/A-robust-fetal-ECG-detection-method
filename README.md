This project presents a robust method for detecting the fetal electrocardiogram (FECG) from non-invasive abdominal recordings, inspired by the work of Suzanna M. M. Martens, Chiara Rabotti, Massimo Mischi, and Rob J. Sluijtery.

The methodology employs a sequential analysis pipeline to isolate the faint fetal heart signal. The process begins with pre-processing filters to remove baseline wander and power line interference. Next, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to enhance the maternal QRS complexes, which are then detected using a Pan-Tompkins algorithm. An average maternal heartbeat template is created and subtracted from the signal to cancel out the maternal ECG interference.
Finally, PCA is applied again to the residual signal to enhance the fetal QRS complexes. The fetal heart rate (FHR) is then determined by applying the Pan-Tompkins algorithm to this cleaned signal.
